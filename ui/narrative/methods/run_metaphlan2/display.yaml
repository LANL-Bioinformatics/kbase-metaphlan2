    <p>This is a KBase wrapper for Kraken2, a novel, gene-independent, and signature-based metagenomic taxonomic profiling tool with low false discovery rates (FDR). GOTTCHA2 has been tested and validated on twenty synthetic and mock datasets ranging in community composition and complexity, was applied successfully to data generated from spiked environmental and clinical samples, and robustly demonstrates superior performance compared with other available tools.</p>

        <p>GOTTCHA2 takes either a metagenomic reads library or a reads set as input. Parameters can be set for the reference database and for minimum thresholds for the abundance calculations. GOTTCHA2 uses two reference databases for classification, which can be downloaded from the <a href="https://edge-dl.lanl.gov/GOTTCHA2/RefSeq-Release90/">GOTTCHA2 webserver page</a> (last updated 2018-11-10). The databases are:
          <ul>
            <li><b>RefSeq Bacteria, Archaea and Viruses</b>: Nucleotide unique signature sequences built from NCBI RefSeq Release 90.</li>
            <li><b>RefSeq Fungal </b>: Fungal Nucleotide unique signature sequences built from NCBI RefSeq Release 90. </li>
          </ul>
